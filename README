This is a bot that's being made as a personal project, but it works surprisingly well. As you've probably guessed by now, this bot is written in Python, and therefore is very easy to make customisations for.

Yes, you can use this as you please, but if you do, would you mind not changing the username? It's just a tiny thing...
